    "question": "Universal Containers (UC) has implemented Generative AI within Salesforce to enable summarization of a custom object called Guest. Users have reported mismatches in the generated information. In refining its prompt design strategy, which key practices should UC prioritize?",
    "options": [
      "Enable prompt test mode, allocate different prompt variations to a subset of users for evaluation, and standardize the most effective model based on performance feedback.",
      "Create concise, clear, and consistent prompt templates with effective grounding, contextual role-playing, clear instructions, and iterative feedback.",
      "Submit a prompt review case to Salesforce and conduct thorough testing In the playground to refine outputs until they meet user expectations."
    ],
    "answer": "Create concise, clear, and consistent prompt templates with effective grounding, contextual role-playing, clear instructions, and iterative feedback.",
    "explanation": "To reduce hallucinations and mismatches, prompt engineering best practices dictate that instructions must be concise and clear. 'Grounding' (inserting real CRM data) is the most critical factor in ensuring the summary is accurate to the specific record, while role-playing helps the LLM understand the context and tone required."

      "Agent Event Logs dashboard.",
      "AI Audit and Feedback Data dashboard.",
      "User Utterances dashboard."
    ],
    "answer": "AI Audit and Feedback Data dashboard.",

    "options": [
      "Action Instructions define the expected user experience of an action.",
      "Action Instructions tell the user how to call this action in a conversation.",
      "Action Instructions tell the large language model (LLM) which action to use."
    ],
    "answer": "Action Instructions tell the large language model (LLM) which action to use.",
    "explanation": "In the reasoning engine of Agentforce (formerly Copilot), the 'Action Instructions' are not for the end-user. They are semantically matched by the LLM against the user's intent to decide if that specific action is the correct tool to solve the user's request."

      "Switch the data library source from file uploads to a Knowledge-based data library.",
      "Configure a custom retriever that includes a filter condition limiting retrieval to documents updated within a defined recent period.",
      "Continue using the default retriever without filters."
    ],
    "answer": "Configure a custom retriever that includes a filter condition limiting retrieval to documents updated within a defined recent period.",
    "explanation": "When using Data Cloud retrievers (RAG), relevance is improved by filtering. By creating a custom retriever with a filter condition (e.g., 'LastModifiedDate > Last 365 Days'), you ensure the LLM only grounds its answers in current content, ignoring obsolete files."

    ],
    "answer": "Agent analyzes the user's request and LLM technology is used to generate and display the appropriate response.",
    "explanation": "The Agent (Copilot) architecture uses a reasoning engine. It takes the user's natural language input, analyzes the intent using an LLM, selects the appropriate actions (if needed), and then generates a natural language response."

      "Create a Flex prompt template in Prompt Builder.",
      "Create a custom copilot action which calls a flow.",
      "Configure the Integration Flow Standard Action in Agent."
    ],
    "answer": "Create a custom copilot action which calls a flow.",
    "explanation": "To extend the capabilities of an Agent, you create 'Actions'. Since the logic to fetch data from Oracle ERP already exists in a Flow, the most efficient method is to wrap that Flow in a Custom Copilot Action (Agent Action), making it accessible to the reasoning engine."

      "Create a Trust Layer audit report within Data Cloud that uses a toxicity detector type filter."
    ],
    "answer": "Create a Trust Layer audit report within Data Cloud that uses a toxicity detector type filter.",
    "explanation": "Since the Trust Layer logs are stored in Data Cloud, the standard way to analyze them is by creating reports or dashboards (using tools like CRM Analytics or Data Cloud reports) that filter for specific detector types, such as 'Toxicity'."

      "Responses that do not meet the relevance threshold will be automatically rejected."
    ],
    "answer": "Masked data will be de-masked during response journey.",
    "explanation": "The Trust Layer masks sensitive data (like PII) before sending it to the external LLM. When the LLM generates a response using the masked tokens, the Trust Layer 'demasks' it on the way back to the user so the final output makes sense."

      "The Einstein Trust Layer is incorrectly configured."
    ],
    "answer": "The data being used for grounding is incorrect or incomplete.",
